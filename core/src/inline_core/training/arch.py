"""What differs between the architectures we train LoRAs for.

Every arch shares the whole harness - dataset export, precache-then-free, PEFT adapter,
checkpoint/resume, the JSON-line protocol - and they differ in only four things: which Linears to
adapt, how a noise level maps to a timestep, what the model is asked to predict, and how one forward
call is shaped. Those four live here so ``trainer.py`` stays one loop.

All of them are rectified flow, but with **opposite conventions**, which is exactly the kind of
detail a test should pin: Z-Image and MiniMax H3 predict ``clean - noise`` at timestep
``1 - sigma``, while Krea 2, FLUX.2 and LTX-2.5 predict ``noise - clean`` at timestep ``sigma``.

LTX-2.5 is the one that looks like a third convention and is not. Its published model is an
``X0Model`` returning a denoised latent, but that is a weightless wrapper over a velocity model, and
training attaches underneath it.
