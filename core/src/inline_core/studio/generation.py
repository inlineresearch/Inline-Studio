"""Core-node generation on the single-process path - ported from the Studio
``electron/main/generation/coreExecutor.ts``, but running the graph through Core's in-process
``RunManager`` instead of over HTTP.

``run_workflow`` serializes a canvas node's upstream closure, submits it, and drains the run's event
stream, translating Core run events into the Studio generation events the SPA listens for
(``events:generationProgress`` / ``NodeDone`` / ``Done`` / ``Error``). Each produced take is copied
into the project's ``takes/`` dir and stored as its Core node's output. Fire-and-forget: the call
returns immediately; progress arrives over ``/events``.
