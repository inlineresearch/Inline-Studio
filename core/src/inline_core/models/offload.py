"""Turn the device policy's verdict into a concrete quantisation and offload recipe.

The policy owns *what* plan a model gets ("resident", "int8", "offload", "wont-fit"). This module
owns *how* that plan is carried out for a model too large to simply place, which is the case
diffusers' ``enable_model_cpu_offload`` does not cover: a 60 GB transformer needs its blocks
streamed from host RAM while it runs, not swapped whole.

Nothing here picks a device. It reads the plan the policy already chose, which is the rule that
keeps one graph portable across a 4090, a laptop and a CPU box.

Torch-free at import, like ``models/sampling.py``'s data layer: the recipe is a dataclass anyone can
inspect, and torch/torchao are imported lazily inside ``apply_offload``.

## The ordering rule

A **structural transform** rewrites what a layer *is*: factorising a projection through a low-rank
basis, splitting a fused QKV, swapping the halves of a gated FFN, folding a LoRA. Three clauses,
which are not negotiable and which every quantised path has to honour:

1. **Structural transforms run on unquantised weights.** They are linear algebra on the real values.
2. **Quantisation is always last.** It is the final step before placement, never the middle one.
3. **A prequantized source cannot accept a structural transform at all.** Its values are gone; what
   remains is codes plus scales, and the transform has nothing to operate on.

Clause 3 is a hard limit, not an inconvenience to engineer around. It is why nobody can factorise
Comfy-Org's ``int8_convrot`` H3 build, or apply one to FLUX.2's prequantized NF4 checkpoints: those
paths must pass ``Quantization.NONE`` and skip the transform, or fail loudly. Violating clause 2
raises deep inside torchao (``Int8Tensor`` has no ``aten.mm``), which is a good outcome; violating
clause 1 would not raise at all, it would just quietly compute the transform on rounded values.
