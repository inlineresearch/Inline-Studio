/**
 * The clip frame grids, mirrored from Core so the Trainer can show what a clip length actually

 *
 * A video VAE only encodes `grid * n + offset` frames, and Core snaps **down** onto that grid.
 * Asking H3 for 5s therefore trains on 4.458s, and the shortfall comes off the end. That was silent
 * until the number appeared next to the field, and a user lost the action in the last half second of
 * their clips to it.
 *
 * Note the direction. Generation snaps **up** and then clamps (`models/video_params.py`), because a
 * request should be honoured where it is legal. Training snaps down, because a clip does not have
 * frames the file never held. The two are separate on purpose.
